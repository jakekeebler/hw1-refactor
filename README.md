# <Code Refactor>

## Description

A website that meets accessibility standards was given to me and my task was to refactor the code, making it easier for other developers to view and update the source code. This repository is the result of my refactoring.

## Usage

The main use of this project is to look at how clean the code is. That's it! To see the differences between old and new, there is an changelog.txt that points out lines of code that were changed.
